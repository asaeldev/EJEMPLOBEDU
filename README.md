## What is GitHub markdown?
The Markdown API enables you to render a markdown document as an HTML page or as raw text.

You can read more about GitHub markdown in the following link:
- Markdown: https://docs.github.com/en/rest/markdown

As the programming language is not important right now, I am only practicing GitHub markdown. You can read how to get started with markdown in the following page: [Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

GitHub markdown is useful for documenting projects that live in GitHub. Documentation is really important when working collaboratively, as an advice, you can include a brief description of your project and also the steps that need to be followed for setting up your project in case more developers collaborate with you.
